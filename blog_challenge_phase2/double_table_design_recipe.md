# Two Tables Design Recipe Template

_Copy this recipe template to design and create two related database tables from a specification._

## 1. Extract nouns from the user stories or specification

```
# EXAMPLE USER STORY:
# (analyse only the relevant part - here the final line).

As a blogger
So I can write interesting stuff
I want to write posts having a title.

As a blogger
So I can write interesting stuff
I want to write posts having a content.

As a blogger
So I can let people comment on interesting stuff
I want to allow comments on my posts.

As a blogger
So I can let people comment on interesting stuff
I want the comments to have a content.

As a blogger
So I can let people comment on interesting stuff
I want the author to include their name in comments.
```

```
Nouns:

blogger, stuff, posts, title, content, people, comments, author
```

## 2. Infer the Table Name and Columns

Put the different nouns in this table. Replace the example with your own nouns.

| Record                | Properties          |
| --------------------- | ------------------  |
| posts                 | name, post_content,
| comments              | comments_content, author

1. Name of the first table (always plural): `posts` 

    Column names: `name` `post_content`

2. Name of the second table (always plural): `commments` 

    Column names: `comments_content` `author`

## 3. Decide the column types.

[Here's a full documentation of PostgreSQL data types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html).

Most of the time, you'll need either `text`, `int`, `bigint`, `numeric`, or `boolean`. If you're in doubt, do some research or ask your peers.

Remember to **always** have the primary key `id` as a first column. Its type will always be `SERIAL`.

```
# EXAMPLE:

Table: posts
id: SERIAL
name: text
post_content: text

Table: comments
id: SERIAL
comments_content: text
author: text
```

## 4. Decide on The Tables Relationship

Most of the time, you'll be using a **one-to-many** relationship, and will need a **foreign key** on one of the two tables.

To decide on which one, answer these two questions:

1. Can one POST have many COMMENTS? YES
2. Can one COMMENT have many POSTS? NO

You'll then be able to say that:

1. POSTS has many COMMENTS
2. And on the other side, COMMENTS belongs to POSTS
3. In that case, the foreign key is in the table COMMENTS


*If you can answer YES to the two questions, you'll probably have to implement a Many-to-Many relationship, which is more complex and needs a third table (called a join table).*

## 4. Write the SQL.

```sql
-- EXAMPLE
-- file: posts_table.sql

-- Replace the table name, columm names and types.

-- Create the table without the foreign key first.
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name text,
  post_content text
);

-- Then the table with the foreign key first.
CREATE TABLE comments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  comments_content text,
  author text,
-- The foreign key name is always {other_table_singular}_id
  post_id int,
  constraint fk_post foreign key(post_id)
    references posts(id)
    on delete cascade
);

```

## 5. Create the tables.

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 blog < blog.sql
```
